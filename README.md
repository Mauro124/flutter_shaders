# Flutter Shader Proof of Concept

This project demonstrates the use of custom GLSL shaders in Flutter. 
The goal of this proof of concept is to showcase how Flutter can be extended with custom shaders for real-time image manipulation.

## Features

- **Interactive "Light" Effect**: As the user moves their finger across the screen, an image gradually appear.
- **Custom GLSL Shader**: The effect is implemented using GLSL shaders, providing a high level of control over the visual appearance.
- **Flutter Integration**: Seamless integration of custom shaders with Flutter widgets, demonstrating how to use shaders for interactive effects.
